# Prog07. zfill() adds zero characters at the beginning of the string to reach a specified width. 
# Create a program that does the same functionality without using zfill() function.

# Define a function zero_fill that takes a string and width as input.
# If the string length is less than width:
#     Add '0' characters to the left until the width is reached.
# Return the modified string.
