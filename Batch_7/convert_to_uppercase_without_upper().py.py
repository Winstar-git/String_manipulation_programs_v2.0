# Prog03. upper() converts all characters of the string into uppercase. 
# Create a program that does the same functionality without using upper() function.

# Define a function to_upper that takes a string as input.
# Initialize an empty result string.
# Loop through each character in the string.
#     If the character is lowercase ('a' to 'z'):
#         Convert it to uppercase by subtracting 32 from its ASCII value.
#     Append the character to the result.
# Return the result.
