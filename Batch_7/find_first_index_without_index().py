# Prog09. index() returns the first location of the function parameter in the string. 
# Create a program that does the same functionality without using index() function.

# Define a function find_index that takes a string and a character as input.
# Loop through each character in the string with an index.
#     If the character matches the input character, return the index.
# Return -1 if the character is not found.
