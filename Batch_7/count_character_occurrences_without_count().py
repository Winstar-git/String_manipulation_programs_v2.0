# Prog08. count() returns how many times the function parameter appears in the string. 
# Create a program that does the same functionality without using count() function.

# Define a function count_occurrences that takes a string and a character as input.
# Initialize a counter variable to 0.
# Loop through each character in the string.
#     If the character matches the input character, increment the counter.
# Return the counter value.
