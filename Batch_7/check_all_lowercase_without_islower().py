# Prog04. islower() checks if all characters of the string are in lowercase. 
# Create a program that does the same functionality without using islower() function.

# Define a function is_all_lowercase that takes a string as input.
# Loop through each character in the string.
#     If the character is uppercase ('A' to 'Z'), return False.
# Return True if no uppercase letters are found.
