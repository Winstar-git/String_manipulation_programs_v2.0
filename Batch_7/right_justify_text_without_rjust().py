# Prog06. rjust() adds space characters at the beginning of the string to reach a specified width. 
# Create a program that does the same functionality without using rjust() function.

# Define a function right_justify that takes a string and width as input.
# If the string length is less than width:
#     Add spaces to the left until the width is reached.
# Return the modified string.
