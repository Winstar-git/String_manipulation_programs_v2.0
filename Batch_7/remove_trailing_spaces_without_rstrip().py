# Prog01. rstrip() removes the space characters at the end of the string. 
# Create a program that does the same functionality without using rstrip() function.

# Define a function remove_trailing_spaces that takes a string as input.
# Initialize an index variable to the last character of the string.
# Loop while the index is non-negative and the current character is a space.
#     Decrement the index.
# Return the substring up to the last non-space character.
