# Prog08. swapcase() reverses the casing of each character in the string. 
# Create a program that does the same functionality without using swapcase() function.

# Define a function swap_case that takes a string as input.
# Initialize an empty result string.
# Loop through each character in the string.
#     If the character is uppercase ('A' to 'Z'):
#         Convert it to lowercase.
#     Else if the character is lowercase ('a' to 'z'):
#         Convert it to uppercase.
#     Append the converted character to the result.
# Return the result.
