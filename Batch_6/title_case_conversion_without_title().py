# Prog10. title() makes the first letter of each word in the string uppercase, and all other letters lowercase. 
# Create a program that does the same functionality without using title() function.

# Define a function to_title_case that takes a string as input.
# Split the string into words.
# Loop through each word.
#     Apply capitalize_first function to each word.
# Join the words back into a single string with spaces.
# Return the modified string.
