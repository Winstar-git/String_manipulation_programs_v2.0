# Prog06. ljust() adds space characters at the end of the string to complete the specified number of characters. 
# Create a program that does the same functionality without using ljust() function.

# Define a function left_justify that takes a string and width as input.
# If the string length is less than width:
#     Add spaces to the right until the width is reached.
# Return the modified string.
