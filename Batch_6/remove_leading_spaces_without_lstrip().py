# Prog01. lstrip() remove the space characters at the beginning of the string. 
# Create a program that do the same functionality without using lstrip() function.

# Pseudo code:
# Define a function remove_leading_spaces that takes a string as input.
# Initialize an index variable to 0.
# Loop while the index is within the string length and the current character is a space.
#     Increment the index.
# Return the substring starting from the first non-space character.
