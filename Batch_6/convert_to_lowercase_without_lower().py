# Prog03. lower() converts all characters of the string into lower case. 
# Create a program that do the same functionality without using lower() function.

# Define a function to_lowercase that takes a string as input.
# Initialize an empty string for the result.
# Loop through each character in the string.
#     If the character is uppercase ('A' to 'Z'):
#         Convert it to lowercase by adding 32 to its ASCII value.
#     Append the character to the result.
# Return the result.
