# Prog07. center() adds space characters at the beginning and end of the string to print it at the center. 
# Create a program that does the same functionality without using center() function.

# Define a function center_text that takes a string and width as input.
# Compute the total padding needed.
# Divide the padding evenly between left and right.
# Concatenate spaces, the string, and spaces.
# Return the centered string.
