# String_manipulation_programs_v2.0

## Overview

This repository contains Python implementations of various string manipulation functions without using built-in string methods. The programs replicate the behavior of common string methods such as trimming whitespace, changing case, checking substrings, and formatting text. Each function is manually implemented to demonstrate fundamental string operations in Python.

## Program Batches

**Batch 6**: Focuses on string modification and analysis.

**Batch 7**: Covers additional string operations, including formatting, searching, and counting.

These implementations provide a deeper understanding of string operations, making them useful for learning and problem-solving.
